### Get ready for the session

First thing, we need to download the workshop materials from Github:

```
$ cd /data
$ git clone https://github.com/PawseySC/containers-astronomy-workshop.git
$ cd containers-astronomy-workshop/exercises
$ export EXERCISES=$(pwd)
```
{: .bash}

Here we're defining the variable `EXERCISES`, pointing to the subdirectory of the repository that contains inputs and scripts for the various examples.

### Useful base images

Depending on the type of application you need to containerise, various public images can represent an effective starting point, in shipping ready-to-use utilities that have been containerised, tested and optimised by their own authors.  Relevant to this workshop are:

* Python images, such as `python:3.8` and `python:3.8-slim` (a lightweight version); we're going to use the `slim` version to avoid including unneeded packages in our images; here are the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) repo and the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/master/3.8/buster/slim/Dockerfile);

* Conda images by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), such as `continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2`; again, we prefer `miniconda3` over `anaconda3` to exclude unnecessary packages; see [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda3) and [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/docker-images/blob/master/miniconda3/debian/Dockerfile);

* Intel optimised Python images, *i.e.* `intelpython/intelpython3_core:2020.2` and `intelpython/intelpython3_full:2020.2`; we're going to use the `core` image for the same reasons as above; see [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/intelpython/intelpython3_core) and [Dockerfile](https://github.com/IntelPython/container-images/blob/master/configs/intelpython3_core/Dockerfile);

* Pawsey MPI images, such as the MPICH one that we're using here, `pawsey/mpich-base:3.1.4_ubuntu18.04`; see [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pawsey/mpich-base) and [Dockerfile](https://github.com/PawseySC/pawsey-containers/blob/master/mpich-base/Dockerfile);

* CUDA images, including:
    - `nvidia/cuda:10.2-base-ubuntu18.04`;
    - `nvidia/cuda:10.2-runtime-ubuntu18.04`;
    - `nvidia/cuda:10.2-devel-ubuntu18.04`;

  we're using the `devel` image as we need the full *CUDA SDK* for Numba; see [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) and Dockerfiles: [base](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/-/blob/master/dist/10.2/ubuntu18.04-x86_64/base/Dockerfile), [runtime](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/-/blob/master/dist/10.2/ubuntu18.04-x86_64/runtime/Dockerfile), [devel](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/-/blob/master/dist/10.2/ubuntu18.04-x86_64/devel/Dockerfile).

Other useful base images, not directly used in this context, include:

* Jupyter images, in particular the `jupyter/` repository by [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io) (unfortunately making extensive use of the `latest` tag); for instance, the scientific Python image `jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest`, see [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook);

* OS images, such as `ubuntu:18.04`, `debian:buster` and `centos:7`.

Note that the `python`, `miniconda3`, and `intelpython` images are all based on Debian OS (currently version 10 *Buster*).  The Pawsey `mpich-base` and `cuda` images are based on Ubuntu 18.04.

All of the mentioned images are currently hosted in Docker Hub.  In addition to the image itself, it is worth having an idea of what the corresponding Dockerfile looks like, both to know how the image was created and to get tips on how to optimally use it.  
Having the Dockerfiles is also useful in case one needs an image with multiple utilities.  Then, intelligently merging the Dockerfiles will do the job.


### Some building best practices

Always keep in mind that writing a Dockerfile is almost an art, which you can refine over time with practice.  Here we don't mean to be exhaustive; instead, we're providing some good practices to start with, with some *Ubuntu/Debian* examples where relevant.  These practices will then be applied to the examples further down, and in the next episodes.


1. **Condensate commands into few `RUN` instructions**

    This reduces the number of image caching *layers*, and thus the total size of the Docker image.  
    
    Why is it so?  
    At one extreme, imagine one `RUN` per command.  Any edit to the same files in the container or any deletion of unnecessary files would create a separate layer (*i.e.* snapshot).  The final container would be larger.  
    On the other extreme, concentrating every command in one `RUN` would minimise image size, as there would be one single layer.  As a disadvantage, readability of the Dockerfile would be reduced, and caching during build would become less effective.
    
    In the end, the best practice is to group together commands that relate to the same component of the installation.  Readability and caching are improved in this way, and you would not gain space anyway if you further grouped them, as these groups of commands operate on different files.
    
    Note how this is a benefit only for images in the Docker format.  When converting to the Singularity *SIF* format, layers are squashed in a single object anyway.


2. **Clean the installation process**

    Installation files that are not required by the application runtime can be deleted, contributing to reduce the final image size (when coupled with practice `1.` above).  
    
    As a first *Ubuntu* example, here's how to run a clean `apt` installation:

    In our example with samtools, you would clean the `apt` installations with the following commands:
    
    ```
    RUN apt-get update \
          && apt-get -y install \
            build-essential \
            gfortran \
          && apt-get clean all && \
          apt-get purge && \
          rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
    ```
    {: .source}
    
    and here is how to tidy up a software compilation:
    
    ```
    RUN mkdir -p /tmp/tool-build \
          && cd /tmp/tool-build \
          [..]
          <INSTALL YOUR TOOL>
          [..]
          && cd / \
          && rm -rf /tmp/tool-build
    ```
    {: .source}


3. **Abstract package versions, if you can**

    The `ARG` instruction can be used to define variables in the Dockerfile, that only exist within the build process.  This can be especially useful to specify package versions in a more general and flexible way.
    
    As a general example:
    
    ```
    ARG TOOL_VERSION="2.0"
    ```
    {: .source}
    
    Then, you can use `$TOOL_VERSION` along the package build commands. 
    
    A nice feature of `docker build` is that you can dynamically assign these `ARG` at build time using the `--build-arg` flag, *e.g.* if you want to install version `3.0`:
    
    ```
    $ sudo docker build -t tool --build-arg TOOL_VERSION="3.0" .
    ```
    {: .bash}


4. **Consider build reproducibility, if you can**

    A big part of using containers is *runtime* reproducibility.  

    However, it can be worth reflecting on *build time* reproducibility, too.  
    In other words, if I re-run an image build with the same Dockerfile over time, am I getting the same image as output?  This can be important for an image curator, to be able to guarantee *to some extent* that the image they're build and shipping is the one they mean to.

    A couple of general advice here:
    * rely on explicit versioning of the key packages in your image as much as possible.  This may include OS version, key library and key dependency versions, end-user application version (this latter is possibly obvious); typically this involves a trade-off between versioning too much and too little;
    * for Python/Conda, track versioned packages to install using a `requirements` approach; see examples further down;
    * avoid generic package manager update commands, which make you lose control on versions.  In particular, you should avoid `apt-get upgrade`, `pip install --upgrade`, `conda update` and so on;
    * avoid downloading sources/binaries for `latest` versions, specify the version number instead.


5. **Know and set some useful environment variables**

    Dockerfile installations are non-interactive by nature, *i.e.* no installer can ask you questions during the process.  
    In *Ubuntu/Debian*, you can define a variable prior to running any `apt` command, that informs a shell in Ubuntu or Debian that you are not able to interact, so that no questions will be asked:
    
    ```
    ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"
    ```
    {: .source} 
    
    Another pair of useful variables, again to be put at the beginning of the Dockerfile, are:
    
    ```
    ENV LANG="C.UTF-8" LC_ALL="C.UTF-8"
    ```
    {: .source}
    
    These variables are used to specify the language localisation, or *locale*, to the value *C.UTF-8* in this case.  Leaving this undefined can result, for some programs, in warnings or even in unintended behaviours (both at build and run time).


6. **Document your Dockerfile with labels**

    This is a way to provide information to third party users of your container image, to enable a more effective use.  
    For instance you can add a *maintainer* label:
    
    ```
    LABEL maintainer="john.doe@nowhere.com"
    ```
    {: .source}


7. **Think about the default command**

    The Docker instruction `CMD` can be used to set the default command that gets executed by `docker run <IMAGE>` (without arguments) or `singularity run <IMAGE>`.  
    If you don't specify it, the default will be the `CMD` specified by the base image, or the shell if the latter was not defined.  

    Our suggestion for the vast majority of containers is to set it to `/bin/bash`.  
    You might think of using an application binary instead, but in the end this is not very useful.  In fact, the `CMD` default gets overridden by any command/argument you add to the `run` commands, in which case you would need to explicitly state the main command anyway.  Moreover, if your container ships multiple executables, some will be left out anyway.

    There are only a few exception to this general advice.  
    For Python and R containers, you might set it to the `python` and `R` interpreter, respectively.  
    Do not set `CMD` for `rocker/` RStudio and `jupyter/` Jupyter images; these come with articulated setups that allow to spawn the web servers, so your choice would be ignored anyway.


### A Ubuntu example

To get started, let's comment on a simple example, where we're using a *Ubuntu* image and we want to add some developer tools using `apt`: some build tools, *git* and *wget8.  We're going to use it to practice with advice 1 to 3 above.  The corresponding files are in the directory `1.ubuntu/`.

The simplest *Dockerfile*, `Dockerfile.1`, looks like:

```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y \
           build-essential \
           gfortran \
           git \
           wget
```
{: .source}

We can build an image called `u1` via:

```
$ docker build -t u1 -f Dockerfile.1 .
```
{: .bash}

Once built, interestingly we can see from `docker images` that the image size is 379 MB:

```
REPOSITORY                      TAG                                   IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
[..]
u1                              latest                                f513ff384910        28 hours ago        379MB
[..]
```
{: .output}

Let's see if we can reduce the image size (practice no. 2), using `Dockerfile.2`:

```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y \
           build-essential \
           gfortran \
           git \
           wget

RUN apt-get clean all \
      && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
{: .source}

Now, let's build the new image.  Can you see the process is almost instantaneous? This is layer caching in action!  
However, if we have a look at the size, we can see that .. it's still 379 MB!  Well, this makes sense if you think about practice no. 1: we're cleaning using a separate `RUN` command, thus creating a distinct layer.  Then, the files being cleaned up are still snapshotted in the first layer.  Let's then consolidate the two `RUN`s in to one (`Dockerfile.3`):

```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y \
           build-essential \
           gfortran \
           git \
           wget \
      && apt-get clean all \
      && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
{: .source}

The size of the new image is now 350 MB, down 29 MB or about 8%.  Not too bad .. but the benefits of cleaning the image become more significant as you install more packages in it.

Let's now integrate practice 3 in the Dockerfile, to allow flexibility in package versions.  Well, with `apt` we're typically quite constrained in picking versions, so in this case let's try and become flexible with the *Ubuntu* version, see `Dockerfile.4`:

```
ARG OS_VERSION="18.04"
FROM ubuntu:$OS_VERSION

RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y \
           build-essential \
           gfortran \
           git \
           wget \
      && apt-get clean all \
      && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
{: .source}

With this Dockerfile, by default we're going to build the image starting from *Ubuntu* 18.04.  However, we can now change this behaviour at build time, for instance if need 20.04:

```
$ docker build -t u4-20.04 -f Dockerfile.4 --build-arg OS_VERSION="20.04" .
```
{: .bash}


### A Python example: *astropy* using *pip*

Let's practice installing Python packages in a container using *pip*; we'll use the base image `python:3.8-slim`, and the package `astropy` as an example  (files under `1.pip/`).

Here is the first, minimal iteration of the image recipe, `Dockerfile.1`:

```
FROM python:3.8-slim

RUN pip install astropy

CMD [ "/bin/bash" ]
```
{: .source}

Seems straightforward, right?  Note how the Dockerfile is re-defining the default command to the `bash` shell; this is because `python` images set it to the Python console.  Have a look at the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/master/3.8/buster/slim/Dockerfile) for `python:3.8-slim` as a reference.  If you prefer the latter setting, just delete the last line.

Let's build the image, have a look at the output, and then check the image size with `docker images`:

```
$ docker build -t p1 -f Dockerfile.1 .
```
{: .bash}

```

```
{: .output}

A couple of notes here:
* at the time of writing, we're installing `astropy` version `4.0.1.post1`;
* `astropy` also depends on `numpy`, so the `pip` process installs both these packages;
* the final image size is 228 MB.

Can we reduce image size?  Sure, let's have a look at `Dockerfile.2`:

```
FROM python:3.8-slim

RUN pip --no-cache-dir install astropy

CMD [ "/bin/bash" ]
```
{: .source}

If we build this image, we can see that using the option `pip --no-cache-dir` reduces the size by 22 MB, or 10%, to 206 MB.

Now, let's try and add version control to this image.  As in the Dockerfile we're asking `pip` to install `astropy`, we can make its version explicit as in `Dockerfile.3`:

```
FROM python:3.8-slim

ARG ASTRO_VERSION="3.2.3"
RUN pip --no-cache-dir install astropy==$ASTRO_VERSION

CMD [ "/bin/bash" ]
```
{: .source}

In this example, the default installed version is `3.2.3`.  This can be changed at build time with `--build-arg ASTRO_VERSION=<ALTERNATE VERSION>`.

This was easy enough.  Now, how about build reproducibility?  Or, put in other words, are there other packages for which we might need to keep explicit track of the version?  
Well, when we install Python packages, most of them come with some dependency; in this case it's `numpy`.  Let's see ways to track these when building a container.  We're going to see two examples, both of which rely on using a `requirements` file.

#### *pip* build reproducibility, way 1: *pip freeze*

We're now going to adopt a pretty useful strategy when developing Docker files, that is running interactive container sessions to trial things.  First, let's write a `requirements.in` file specifying the package we're after:

```
astropy==3.2.3
```
{: .source}

And now, let's start an interactive session with our base image, `python:3.8-slim`.  We need the current directory to be bind mounted in the container:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data python:3.8-slim bash
```
{: .bash}

Now, from inside the container let's execute the `prepare4.sh` script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# run this from the miniconda3 container
# docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data python:3.8-slim bash

pip install -r requirements.in

REQ_FILE="requirements4-3sep.txt"
pip freeze >$REQ_FILE
```
{: .source}

Here we're performing a trial run of the installation we're after, using the `requirements` file via `pip install -r requirements.in`.  
Then, the useful bit: let's save the obtained `pip` configuration in a file, using `pip freeze`.  The end result, `requirements4-3sep.txt`, contains all the final packages (two in this case) with explicit versions:

```
astropy==3.2.3 
numpy==1.19.1
```
{: .source}

We can then use this file as a reference in the Dockerfile, see `Dockerfile.4`:

```
FROM python:3.8-slim

ARG REQ_FILE="requirements4-3sep.txt"
ADD requirements.in /
ADD $REQ_FILE /requirements.txt
RUN pip --no-cache-dir install --no-deps -r /requirements.txt

CMD [ "/bin/bash" ]
```
{: .source}

We're copying the `requirements` files in the image using `ADD`, and then using the second one to run the `pip` installation (the former is copied just to document it in the image, it's not really required).  We're using the additional flag `install --no-deps` to make sure `pip` is only installing the packages that are listed in the requirements; this is a complete list of packages, as we got it from a real installation.

Now, if we run this build repeatedly over time, we're always ending up with the same set of packages (and versions) in the container image!

#### *pip* build reproducibility, way 2: *pip-tools*

With `pip`, we've got an alternate way to generate our fully specified `requirements` file, that does not require running a full installation interactively.

This alternate way makes use of a Python package called `pip-tools`, see its [*github* page](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools).  We need it installed on the host machine we use to build Docker images, which we can achieve via `pip install pip-tools`.

Then, starting from our initial `requirements.in` file, we can generate the final one simply running:

```
$ pip-compile -o requirements5-3sep.txt requirements.in
```
{: .bash}

The list of packages is consistent with the *pip freeze* way, just with some extra comments:

```
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile
# To update, run:
#
#    pip-compile --output-file=requirements2-3sep.txt requirements.in
#
astropy==3.2.3            # via -r requirements.in
numpy==1.19.1             # via astropy
```
{: .source}


### *astropy* using *conda*

For folks who prefer `conda` over `pip`, let's see how we can get an `astropy` container image with this approach (files under `1.conda/`).  
Let's start with the basic `Dockerfile.1`, which keeps track of `astropy` version only:

```
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2

# note, as of september 2020, "--no-update-deps" seems not to be respected

ARG ASTRO_VERSION="3.2.3"
RUN conda install -y --no-update-deps astropy==$ASTRO_VERSION
```
{: .source}

Note how we're using the `conda install` flag `--no-update-deps` to ask `conda` not to update any package that ships with the base image.  This is intended for better build reproducibility, in that these packages should be defined only by the choice of the base image itself.  However, unfortunately at the time of writing this flag does not seem to work as intended.  

We can build the image with:

```
$ docker build -t c1 -f Dockerfile.1 .
```
{: .bash}

As per typical `conda` installations, the list of new/updated packages is longer than with `pip`, over 30 packages.  
Also, note the final image size is 1.6 GB.

First, let's see how we can reduce the image size using `conda clean`, see `Dockerfile.2`:

```
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2

# note, as of september 2020, "--no-update-deps" seems not to be respected

ARG ASTRO_VERSION="3.2.3"
RUN conda install -y --no-update-deps astropy==$ASTRO_VERSION \
      && conda clean -ay
```
{: .source}

The corresponding image is 1.37 GB large, with a reduction of 230 MB or 14%.

Now, let's focus on build reproducibility, taking again an approach using a `requirements` file.  
Let's start with our specification, `requirements.in`:

```
astropy==3.2.3
```
{: .source}

Now, similar to the *pip* case, let's start an interactive session:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2 bash
```
{: .bash}

And run this preparation script, `prepare3.sh`:

```
#!/bin/bash

# run this from the miniconda3 container
# docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2 bash

conda install --no-update-deps -y  --file requirements.in

REQ_LABEL="3sep"
ENV_FILE="environment-${REQ_LABEL}.yaml"
conda env export >${ENV_FILE}

REQ_FILE="requirements-${REQ_LABEL}.yaml"
cp $ENV_FILE $REQ_FILE
sed -i -n '/dependencies/,/prefix/p' $REQ_FILE
sed -i -e '/dependencies:/d' -e '/prefix:/d' $REQ_FILE
sed -i 's/ *- //g' $REQ_FILE
```
{: .source}

Here we're running a trial installation using `conda install --file requirements.in`.  
Then we can export the versioned packages in the active environment using `conda env export`.  This has a caveat, though.

Environment export in `conda` creates a *YAML* file that allows creation of a completely new environment, including information on the environment name, prefix and channels (see `environment-3sep.yaml` in the directory of this example).  
As we just want this information to install packages in the preexisting base environment of the base image, we need to polish this file, *e.g.* using `sed`.  A bunch of edits will return use the final `requirements-3sep.yaml` (see example directory), which only contain the list of versioned packages.  
This is the requirements file we can use in the Dockerfile, see `Dockerfile.3`:

```
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2

# note, as of september 2020, "--no-update-deps" seems not to be respected

ARG REQ_FILE="requirements-3sep.yaml"
ADD requirements.in /
ADD $REQ_FILE /requirements.yaml

RUN conda install -y --no-deps --file /requirements.yaml \
      && conda clean -ay
```
{: .source}

Note how we're now using the option `conda install --no-deps`, to tell `conda` not to consider any package dependency for installation, but just those packages in the requirements list.  In principle, this is dangerous and can lead to broken environments, but here we're safe as we obtained this list by exporting a real, functional environment.

#### Shell variables and *conda* environment settings

This is one more aspect worth mentioning when dealing with `conda` container images.  

So, `conda activate` run in a Dockerfile would not work as intended, as variable settings would only leave inside the corresponding `RUN` layer.  
Then, another way might be to embed environment sourcing inside *profile* files, such as `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or even something like `/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`.  However, these files are only sourced when *bash* is launched, so for instance not when running a *python* execution directly.  Also, files under home, `~/`, would not work with Singularity: Docker home is the *root* home, whereas Singularity runs as the host user.

In summary, the most robust way to ensure shell variables for the conda environment are set is to set them explicitly in the *Dockerfile* using `ENV` instructions.  

In terms of general conda variables, the `continuumio` base images all set a modified `PATH` variable, so that conda and binaries in the base environment are found.  
Explicitly setting also the `CONDA_PREFIX` is not done in the base image, so it does not hurt doing it in our Dockerfile, see `Dockerfile.4`:

```
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2

# note, as of september 2020, "--no-update-deps" seems not to be respected

ARG REQ_FILE="requirements-3sep.yaml"
ADD requirements.in /
ADD $REQ_FILE /requirements.yaml

RUN conda install -y --no-deps --file /requirements.yaml \
      && conda clean -ay

# conda activate is not robustly usable in a container.
# then, go for an environment check in a test container, 
# to see if you need to set any package specific variables in the container:
#
# run this from the miniconda3 container
# docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2 bash
#
# env >before
# conda install <..>
# env >after
# diff before after

# this one is always good to have
ENV CONDA_PREFIX="/opt/conda"
```
{: .source}

How about the extra comments in this Dockerfile?  
Well, this is not the case for *astropy* but, depending on the installed packages, additional variables might be added to the shell environment.

It's possible to capture them by running another trial installation interactively, and comparing the environment before and after it's done:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data continuumio/miniconda3:4.8.2 bash
```
{: .bash}

```
/# env >before
/# conda install <..>
/# env >after
/# diff before after
```
{: .bash}

If there are any spare variables, it's advisable to review them, and include relevant ones in the Dockerfile using `ENV` instructions.
