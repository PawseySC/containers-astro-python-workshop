### Get ready for the session

First thing, we need to download the workshop materials from Github:

```
$ cd /data
$ git clone https://github.com/PawseySC/containers-astronomy-workshop.git
$ cd containers-astronomy-workshop/exercises
$ export EXERCISES=$(pwd)
```
{: .bash}

Here we're defining the variable `EXERCISES`, pointing to the subdirectory of the repository that contains inputs and scripts for the various examples.


> ## Trick: get rid of *sudo docker*
> 
> Docker requires administrative rights to be used, so in principle every command requires *sudo*, as in `sudo docker`.  
> 
> To save typing, you may want to add your user to the `docker` user group:
> 
> ```
> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
> ```
> {: .bash}
> 
> then exit the terminal session and open a fresh new one.  
> 
> From now on, you can run `docker` without *sudo*.  
> Note that under the hood *docker* commands will still require admin rights.
